    <p>Autogenerated XML binding files.  Generated from the NCPDP SCRIPT
    schemas.  Used to parse the medication history returned by the
    PDMP.</p>
    <p>Because the schemas cannot be freely distributed we cannot
    include them in the source tree so instead we have checked in
    these files.</p>
